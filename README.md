This repository accompanies the **Transcranial Ultrasound Sonication at Sub-Cubic Millimeter Resolution with Standing Waves via a Pair of Orthogonal Transducers** paper, by Kasra Naftchi-Ardebili, Mike D. Menz, Hossein Salahshoor, Gerald R. Popelka, Stephen A. Baccus, and Kim Butts Pauly. The paper offers a thorough treatment of advantages of using a pair of ultrasound transducers at orthogonal angle. Pressure simulations as well as acoustic radiation force analyses are under the ARF folder. Code pertaining to strain and the unipolar pressures method are under Strain and Unipolar folders, respectively. Every folder contains a MATLAB simulation file where we have simulated the various scenarios in k-Wave, as well as a Python notebook where we have carried out the analysis. Although readers can run the MATLAB files to generate the data for later analysis using the Python notebooks, we have also made the raw data available for direct download from within the Python notebooks inside each folder.
